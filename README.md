### What?

This is the version controlled .vim folder used by me. I use this repo to port my vim setups among machines.

### How?

To use this setups for vim, clone this repo to your local `$HOME` folder and run the make command

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jiananlu/.vim.git ${HOME}/.vim
make
```

If you have done this before and want start over, clean first before retry

```bash
make clean
make
```

### Why?

The `.vimrc` file contains a collection of useful settings to start using vim.
It also contains a collection of useful vim plugins/color schemes.
